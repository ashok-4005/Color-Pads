# COLOR PADS

This project has been built to explore basic state management techniques in React, such as how individual components can maintain their own state and also share state with a parent component.

The React app consists of eight div elements arranged in a grid. Each div has its own individual state, which can be changed independently. Additionally, there is a button that can update the state of all the divs at once. Initially, each div is assigned a boolean value from an external array, with each div having a unique ID. The boolean values can be toggled using the useState hook.
